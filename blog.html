  <ol>
    <li>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</li>
    <p>Answer: Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.</p>

        1. getElementsByTagName()
        2. getElementsByClassName()
        3. getElementById()
        4. querySelector()
        5. querySelectorAll()</p>
    <br>
    <li>What is an event bubble?</li>
    <p>Answer:
        Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy.</p>
    <br>
    <li>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</li>
    <p>Answer: We need callback functions to make sure that a function is only going to get executed after a specific task is completed and not before its completion.</p>
